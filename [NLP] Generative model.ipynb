I can cop that\\nYou wanna do the hard top or the top back?\\nGave young niggas choice\\nAnd we ain’t going back to being broke\\nAnd when they see a nigga drown by the flow\\nNow I’m laid in the shade, getting paid while I smoke\\nAnd I’mma pass it if you open, don’t talk, keep rollin'\\nStay high above all, like fuck it we ball and it’s so well spoken\\nDead presidents speak for me, good girls be some freaks for me\\nGot a new technique and it’s so unique, man the flow antique\\nThe album coming pray for the leak\\nIf he sayin he high then he tweaked\\nWith the new world he coulda bought a Jeep\\nAnd you know it’s all love when you see me in the streets\\nYou know I wanna be alone with you girl\\nSwear I’ll bring that money home to you girl\\nThese niggas weak, I’m smoking strong wit you girl\\nNo bongs wit you girl\\n[Hook]5Embed\""
