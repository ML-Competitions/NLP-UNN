joint\\nA from sun to sun and from day to day\\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\\nI\\'ve created a devastating masterpiece\\nI\\'m gonna rock the mic \\'til you can\\'t resist\\nEverybody, I say it goes like this\\nWell, I was coming home late one dark afternoon\\nReporter stopped me for a interview\\nShe said she\\'s heard stories and she\\'s heard fables\\nThat I\\'m vicious on the mic and the turntables\\nThis young reporter, I did adore\\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\\nShe said, \"Damn, fly guy, I\\'m in love with you\\nThe Casanova legend must have been true\"\\nI said, \"By the way, baby, what\\'s your name?\"\\nSaid \"I go by the name Lois Lane\"\\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can\\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman\\nI said, \"He\\'s a fairy, I do suppose\\nFlying through the air in pantyhose\\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit\"\\nI said, \"You need a man who\\'s got finesse\\nAnd his whole name across his chest\\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\\nBut can he rock a party \\'til the early light?\\nHe can\\'t satisfy you with his little worm\\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm\"\\nI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it\\nAn\\' I\\'m here and I\\'m there, I\\'m Big Bank Hank, I\\'m everywhere\\nA just throw your hands up in the air\\nAnd party hardy like you just don\\'t care\\nLet\\'s do it, a don\\'t stop, y\\'all, a tick a tock, y\\'all, you don\\'t stop\\n\\n[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\\nIt go, \"Hotel, motel, a what you gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\\n\\'Cause I\\'m gon\\' get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ\\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\"\\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend\\n\\n[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\\nI say skip, dive, what can I say?\\nI can\\'t fit \\'em all inside my OJ\\nSo I just take half and bust them out\\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house\\n\\n[Verse 7: Master Gee]\\nIt was twelve o\\'clock a one Friday night\\nI was rocking to the beat and feeling alright\\nEverybody was dancing on the floor\\nDoing all the things they never did before\\nAnd then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean\\nShe came into the bar, she came into the scene\\nAs she traveled deeper inside the room\\nAll the fellas checked out her white Sassons\\nShe came up to the table, looked into my eyes\\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\\nSo I said to myself, its time for me to release\\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece\\nAnd now people in the house, this is just for you\\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\\nNow, the group ya hear is called Phase 2\\nAnd let me tell ya something we\\'re a hell of a crew\\nOnce a week we\\'re on the street\\nJust a cutting the jams and making it freak\\nFor you to party, got to have the moves\\nSo we\\'ll get right down and give you a groove\\nFor you to dance you got to be hype\\nSo we\\'ll get right down and make ya rock\\nNow the system\\'s on and the girls are there\\nYou definitely have a rocking affair\\nBut let me tell ya something, there\\'s still one fact\\nThat to have a party, got to have a rap\\nSo when the party\\'s over you\\'re making it home\\nAnd trying to sleep before the break of dawn\\nAnd while ya sleeping, you start to dream\\nAnd thinking how ya danced on the disco scene\\nA name appears in your mind\\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\\nIt was Phase 2 a just a doing the do\\nRocking ya down \\'cause ya know we could\\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak\\nA come alive, girls, a get on your feet\\nTo the rhythm of the beat, to the beat, the beat\\nTo the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak\\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says you go on\\nOn and on until the break of dawn\\nNow I got a man coming on right now\\nHe\\'s guaranteed to throw down\\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\\nA come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like\\n\\n[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]\\nI say, a can of beer that\\'s sweeter than honey\\nLike a millionaire that has no money\\nLike a rainy day that is not wet\\nLike a gambling fiend that does not bet\\nLike Dracula without his fangs\\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang\\nLike collard greens that don\\'t taste good\\nLike a tree that\\'s not made out of wood\\nLike going up and not coming down\\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\\nTo the beat, beat, ya do the freak\\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\\nHave you ever went over a friend\\'s house to eat\\nAnd the food just ain\\'t no good?\\nI mean the macaroni\\'s soggy, the peas are mushed\\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\\nA so you try to play it off like you think you can\\nBy saying that you\\'re full\\nAnd then your friend says, \"Mama, he\\'s just being polite\\nHe ain\\'t finished, uh-uh, that\\'s bull\"\\nA so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\\nAnd you say that you already ate\\nAnd your friend says, \"Man, there\\'s plenty of food\"\\nSo you pile some more on your plate\\nBut while the stinky food\\'s steaming, your mind starts to dreaming\\nOf the moment that it\\'s time to leave\\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken\\'s slowly rotting\\nInto something that looks like cheese\\nOh, so you say that\\'s it, I got to leave this place\\nI don\\'t care what these people think\\nI\\'m just sitting here making myself nauseous\\nWith this ugly food that stinks\\nOh, so you bust out the door while it\\'s still closed\\nStill sick from the food you ate\\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\\nAnd then you call your friend a two weeks later\\nTo see how he has been\\nAnd he says \"I understand about the food\\nBaby bubba, but we\\'re still friends\"\\n\\n[Chorus: Wonder Mike]\\nA with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie\\nThe hip, hip-hop and you don\\'t stop the rockin\\'\\nTo the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie\\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\\n\\n[Post-Chorus: Wonder Mike]\\nI said, \"A Hank, a can ya rock?\\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don\\'t stop?\\nA can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?\"\\nI said, \"A come on, make, m-make the people move\"\\n\\n[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]\\nI go toot the horns and then ring the bell\\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well\\nI\\'m Big Bank, I got clientele\\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\\nI never forgot what I was told\\nIt was the best advice that I ever had\\nIt came from my wise dear old dad\\nHe said, \"Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you\\nAnd don\\'t say a word until I\\'m through\\nNow there\\'s a time to laugh, a time to cry\\nA time to live and a time to die\\nA time to break and a time to chill\\nTo act civilized or act real ill\\nBut whatever ya do in your lifetime\\nYa never let a MC steal your rhyme\"\\nSo from \\'66 to this very day\\nI\\'ll always remember what he had to say\\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\\nI let them know that I\\'m versatile\\nI got style, finesse and a little black book\\nThat\\'s filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\\nBut the thing that separates you from me\\nAnd that is called originality\\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you\\'ve heard\\nI didn\\'t even bite, not a god**** word\\nAnd I say a little more later on tonight\\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\\nA tick a tock, y\\'all, a beat-beat y\\'all\\nA lets rock, y\\'all, ya don\\'t stop\\n\\n[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\\nIt go, \"Hotel, motel, a whatcha gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\\n\\'Cause I\\'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, and drive off in a def OJ\\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\"\\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friends\\n\\n[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]\\nA like that, y\\'all, a to the beat, y\\'all\\nA beat-beat, y\\'all, ya don\\'t stop\\nA Master Gee, am I mellow?\\nIt\\'s on you, so whatcha gonna do?\\n\\n[Verse 10: Master Gee]\\nWell, like Johnny Carson on the late show\\nA like Frankie Crocker in stereo\\nA like the Bar-Kays singing \"Holy Ghost\"\\nThe sounds I throw down, a they\\'re played the most\\nJust a like my man, a Captain Sky\\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\\nWe rock and we don\\'t stop\\nA get off, y\\'all, I\\'m here to give you whatcha got\\nA to the beat that it makes you freak\\nAnd come alive girl, a get on your feet\\nA like a Perry Mason without a case\\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\\nLike the Bar-Kays on the mic\\nLike getting right down for you tonight\\nLike moving your body so ya don\\'t know how\\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\\nLike coming alive to the Master Gee\\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\\nI said the age of one, my life begun\\nAt the age of two, I was doing the do\\nAt the age of three, it was you and me\\nRocking to the sounds of the Master Gee\\nAt the age of four, I was on the floor\\nGiving all the freaks what they bargained for\\nAt the age of five, I didn\\'t take no jive\\n\\'Cause with the Master Gee, it\\'s all the way live\\nAt the age of six, I was a picking up sticks\\nRapping to the beat, my stick was fixed\\nAt the age of seven, I was rocking in heaven\\nDon\\'t ya know I went off?\\nI gotta run on down to the beat, you see\\nGetting right on down, making all the girls\\nJust take of their clothes to the beat, the beat\\nTo the double beat-beat that makes you freak\\nAt the age of eight I was a really great\\n\\'Cause every night, you see, I had a date\\nAt the age of nine I was a right on time\\n\\'Cause every night I had a party rhyme\\nWe\\'re going on and on, and on, on and on\\nThe beat don\\'t stop until the break of dawn\\nA saying on and on, and on, on and on\\nLike a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn\\nA going on and on, and don\\'t ya dare stop\\nA rock-rock, y\\'all, a gimme what ya got\\n\\'Cause I\\'m a hell of a man when I\\'m on the mic\\nI am the definite freak\\'s delight\\nI\\'m a hell of a man when I\\'m on the mic\\nI am the definite freak\\'s delight\\nThey call me the Master Gee, you see\\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\\n\\n[Outro: Master Gee]\\nI\\'m gonna move ya here, I\\'m gonna move ya there\\nI\\'m gonna move you outta this atmosphere\\n\\'Cause I\\'m one of a kind and I\\'ll shocks your mind\\nI\\'ll put the t-t-tickets in your behind\\nSaid, just rock it to the east and
